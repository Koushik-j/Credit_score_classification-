# Credit_score_classification-
Developed a Machine Learning project on classifying the customer by credit score

<h3 align="center">Why this Project ?</h3>
<p>
    Banks and credit card companies calculate your credit score to determine your creditworthiness. It helps banks and credit card companies immediately to issue loans to customers with good creditworthiness. Today banks and credit card companies use Machine Learning algorithms to classify all the customers in their database based on their credit history.

<h3 align="center">Data Analysis</h3>

<h4>Step 1: Import the Data</h4>
<h4>Step 2: Check for null values and remove them if it is present</h4>
<h4>Step 3: Do visualization using plots to understand better about the data </h4>
     <p>
       I have used box-plot for visualization because
       -> Visualizing Distribution: Box plots provide a quick summary of data distribution, showing the spread, central tendency, and outliers.
       -> Outlier Detection: They are particularly effective at detecting outliers, which might be masked in histograms or bar charts.
       -> Comparison Across Groups: Box plots are excellent for comparing distributions between different groups or datasets compactly and clearly.
       -> No Assumption About Distribution Shape: Unlike histograms, box plots do not assume any specific shape for the distribution (e.g., normal distribution),               making them more versatile.
