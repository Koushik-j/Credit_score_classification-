# Credit_score_classification-
Developed a Machine Learning project on classifying the customer by credit score

<h3 align="center">Why this Project ?</h3>
<p>
    Banks and credit card companies calculate your credit score to determine your creditworthiness. It helps banks and credit card companies immediately to issue loans to customers with good creditworthiness. Today banks and credit card companies use Machine Learning algorithms to classify all the customers in their database based on their credit history.

<h3 align="center">Data Analysis</h3>

<h4>Step 1: Import the Data</h4>
<h4>Step 2: Check for null values and remove them if it is present</h4>
<h4>Step 3: Do visualization using plots to understand better about the data </h4>
     <p>
       I have used box-plot for visualization because <br>
       -> Visualizing Distribution: Box plots provide a quick summary of data distribution, showing the spread, central tendency, and outliers.<br>
       -> Outlier Detection: They are particularly effective at detecting outliers, which might be masked in histograms or bar charts.<br>
       -> Comparison Across Groups: Box plots are excellent for comparing distributions between different groups or datasets compactly and clearly.<br>
       -> No Assumption About Distribution Shape: Unlike histograms, box plots do not assume any specific shape for the distribution (e.g., normal distribution), making them more versatile.<br>

<h4>Step 4: Create a model by splitting the train and test data and showcase the results</h4>

There’s not much difference in the credit scores of all occupations mentioned in the data.

According to the above visualization, the more you earn annually, the better your credit score is.

Like annual income, the more monthly in-hand salary you earn, the better your credit score will become.

Maintaining more than five accounts is not good for having a good credit score. A person should have 2 – 3 bank accounts only. So having more bank accounts doesn’t positively impact credit scores.

Just like the number of bank accounts, having more credit cards will not positively impact your credit scores. Having 3 – 5 credit cards is good for your credit score.

If the average interest rate is 4 – 11%, the credit score is good. Having an average interest rate of more than 15% is bad for your credit scores.

To have a good credit score, you should not take more than 1 – 3 loans at a time. Having more than three loans at a time will negatively impact your credit scores.

So you can delay your credit card payment 5 – 14 days from the due date. Delaying your payments for more than 17 days from the due date will impact your credit scores negatively.

So delaying 4 – 12 payments from the due date will not affect your credit scores. But delaying more than 12 payments from the due date will affect your credit scores negatively.

An outstanding debt of $380 – $1150 will not affect your credit scores. But always having a debt of more than $1338 will affect your credit scores negatively.
